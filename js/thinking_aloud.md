# Thinking aloud...
This is the first shot at coding some game logic

Let's start off with some pseudo code
I think it would make sense for each square to be an object. What would that object look like?

## OBJECT ATTRIBUTES
```
x coordinate
y coordinate
type of square indicator:
  locked? - yes or no
  empty? - yes or no

function to check the squares around self


colour of square property:
  green
  black
  white


```

# Achieved today
* create object
* create board object with x number of objects square
* written function that can probe
  * right
  * left
  * up
  * down
