# rwck.github.io
Initial setup for first GA project
#Technical Requirements

##Your app must:

* Render a game in the browser
* Switch turns between two players
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

##Necessary Deliverables

* A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
* A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
