# GA Project 1: Initial notes
### Which game?

**Othello**

### What libraries will I need to use?

* jQuery
* Moment.js

---
#### Possible library requirements for more advanced ideas...

* Some means of doing score / player detail storage? Very unsure about how I would go about that...
* Datatables? (probably not)
* Angular.js? - look into (heard of but don't know enough about)
* React.js? - look into (heard of but don't know enough about)

## Milestones

* Design the data structure
* Design the DOM
* Render the board
* Get the pieces to change colour when clicked
* Design the game logic

## Which parts are likely to be difficult?

* Designing the game logic
* More advanced ideas around visuals

## Which parts are likely to be easy?

I'm not yet sure if any of it will be easy...


## Initial thoughts on elements of page
* Board
* Counter with number of pieces remaining
* Some sort of heading section
* Whose turn is it indicator
* Start play button
* Restart game button
* Pause game button
* Undo button
* Sound effects
* Game music???
* I want it to look good on a mobile screen too - responsive design


## Additional pages
* How to play
* History of the game / some kind of background information / Random facts / stats about the game



### Wishlist of other possible things to include

* Leaderboard
* Really nice graphics
* Animations
* Timer for timed / speed play option
* Limited feature version - toggle to switch off all extraneous elements
* Theme picker: click here to toggle through random(?) / preselected(?) colour schemes
* Option to resize board - easier game version / harder game version

### May well be too ambitious but worth having in the back of my mind

* Would be great to create some kind of AI machine opponent
* Could randomly choose any of the possible options
* Best and coolest thing would be to have a genetic algorithm that played out loads and loads of games automatically to work out how the machine should best respond in certain situations. This is probably for another time...

#Technical Requirements

##Your app must:

* Render a game in the browser
* Switch turns between two players
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

##Necessary Deliverables

* A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
* A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
